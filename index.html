                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong><small>I am 20 years olf from a small town in Idaho, Fruitland. I have been raised here and Garden Valley for a majority of my life. I was a 2 sport athlete growing up and was a collegiant athlete for Track & Field until Covid 19.
                    I dropped out of school shortly after Track & Field was on a hault, which led me into Real Estate for over 18 months! It was a fun journey while it lasted, long days and sometimes even longer nights. Although it felt nice to help people
                    acheive a life milestone of buying a home, it left me exhausted in life at 20. With all of that it brings me to today where I am in the roller coaster of life and a life journey that I'm still figuring out!  </small></strong>
                <p><strong><small>I love being challenged and as MJ said it, 'I love demanding more from me than anyone else can demand from me.' I would like to think I push myself quite a bit and pursue the perfect version of myself everyday I get up.</small></strong></p>

                <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
                <strong><small>I am a very simple guy when it comes to hobbies I do the same 4 hobbies all the time. Those hobbies consist of gaming, listening to music, golfing, looking at sport cars, and binge watching football on Sundays. I found a passion for gaming at a super young age
                    it started off around 6 years old when I had a wii. I play first person shooters a strong amount of the time, like Call of Duty series, Valorant, and Halo. I love music, my dad gave me the music taste I have today at a young age as well. He downloaded over 2000 songs on my ipod 4th generation
                    It went from that music to finding artists on spotify and checking out their music, I now have over 4000 songs on my spotify account itself!  I have picked up golf in April of this year, its not much to elaborate on that since I'm super knew to it. I just wanted a challenge and something to help 
                    with my competitive edge that I have. Sport car researching has been an interesting one, I dont know anything about cars other than Lamborghinis, Corvettes, Ferraris, and Porsches. I love the look and power of driving one gives, I have drove atleast one of them once. All at random and a good time!

                <h1>Why a Web Developer?</h1>
                <strong><small>I have always been a quick learner on the way technology works and facinated by it. From a young age I have been using a laptop or ipod playing games etc. When I dropped out of college and had a emptiness feeling as a realtor, I decidied 
                    I needed a new path and one that can fulfilling. My brother was my in to coding and showed me a lot of behind the scenes. I helped him with a few projects and instantly found the passion to want to build things like he was doing. I was discouraged on
                    going back to college for 4 years to get into the field but my brother told me to look into bootcamps as one of his buddies did one in Boise, Idaho and has found success. I did research for about a week and came to the conclusion that Coding Temple was 
                    the way for me to go!

                <h1>Favorite Quotes </h1>
                <strong> Winners Win. Losers Lose. -Eric Thomas</strong>
                <br>
                <strong> We don't burnout because of what we do, we burnout because life makes us forget why we do it. -Inky Johnson</strong>
                <br>
                <strong> Forgive me father, I'm not perfect but I'm worth the work! -Cordae</strong>
                <p>
                    <strong> <small>The first quote speaks to me due to the mindset peice, You can be a winner and win, or a loser and always lose, its your choice everyday when you wake up. The second quote is a reminder to me everyday when I get up and remind myself what my "WHY" is. 
                        I can never forget that because if I do, I will burnout and forget my reason for every day. Finally the last quote, this was in a freestyle by the rap artist Cordae. He said this and it gave me chills down my spine, I know I am not perfect but try and better myself everyday.
                        I just know that I can be stubborn and hard headed to the people around me, but through all of that I am worth it.
